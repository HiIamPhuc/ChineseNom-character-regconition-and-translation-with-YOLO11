# ChineseNom Character Recognition and Translation with YOLO11

This repository contains the implementation for **ChineseNom Character Recognition and Translation using the YOLO11 object detection model**. The project focuses on identifying and potentially translating characters from the ChineseNom script.

**Note:** A detailed description beyond the title is currently not available in the repository's about section.

## Key Features

*   **Object Recognition:** Utilizes the **YOLO11 model** for character recognition.
*   **Fine-tuning:** The YOLO11 model is fine-tuned for this specific task.

## Dataset

The project involves preparing datasets for training:

*   **Image Labeling:** Various techniques were used to label images from a raw dataset.
*   **Data Restructuring:** A processed dataset of ChineseNom Characters was restructured and relabeled.
*   **External Reference:** A relevant dataset is referenced from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quandang/nomnaocr](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quandang/nomnaocr).
*   **Labeling Format:** The labeling follows the **YOLOv5 PyTorch TXT format**.

## Model Training

The process involves **fine-tuning an object recognition model, YOLO11**.
